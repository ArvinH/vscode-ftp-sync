#FTP-Sync extension for VS Code

There are two commands available:

## Ftp-sync: Init

Initialize the configuration file for ftp-sync. Allows to precise FTP connection details and additional options, f.e. automatic upload on save.

## Ftp-sync: Sync Local to Remote

Performs full synchronization for selected local directory. Adds and removes files on FTP server to match local files structure.

## To be added soon:

- Command for downloading code from FTP
- Command for upload code to FTP (unlike sync without removing files on FTP)
- Better error handling (right now there is almost none)

## Found any bugs? Got any questions or ideas?
